        "A database in SQL Server is made up of a collection of tables that stores a specific set of structured data. A table contains a collection of rows, also referred to as records or tuples, and columns, also referred to as attributes.\n",

        "According to what I know and have used I can differentiate SQL and NoSQL in the following ways:-\n",
        "\n",
        "Schema:- SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability:- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Manipulation:- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.\n",
