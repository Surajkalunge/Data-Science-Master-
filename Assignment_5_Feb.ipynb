        "When we hear of OOP, the first thing that comes to mind is Classes and Objects. Before we delve into what these are, let’s see a real-life example. Imagine an architect who creates a blueprint of a house that shows the dimensions, structure, number of rooms, and other details of the house\n",

        "We can think of the blueprint as a class, and the house attributes to be the doors, windows, roof, walls, floor, etc, and a house can have the following actions such as opening/closing the door and window, shielding from the sun, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each time a new house is built from this blueprint, we are actually creating an instance of the class. Now, each house can have different values for its attributes like the color of the walls, the thickness of the doors and windows, etc."

        "Ans-The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the object’s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object."

        "The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on."
