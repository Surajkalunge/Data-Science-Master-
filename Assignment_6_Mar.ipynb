        "\n",
        "Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as \"all people living in a country\" or \"every atom composing a crystal\". Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments."

        "\n",
        "Descriptive statistics mostly focus on the central tendency, variability, and distribution of sample data. Central tendency means the estimate of the characteristics, a typical element of a sample or population, and includes descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and mode. Variability refers to a set of statistics that show how much difference there is among the elements of a sample or population along the characteristics measured, and includes metrics such as range, variance, and standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The distribution refers to the overall \"shape\" of the data, which can be depicted on a chart such as a histogram or dot plot, and includes properties such as the probability distribution function, skewness, and kurtosis. Descriptive statistics can also describe differences between observed characteristics of the elements of a data set. Descriptive statistics help us understand the collective properties of the elements of a data sample and form the basis for testing hypotheses and making predictions using inferential statistics.\n",

        "Inferential Statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "Inferential statistics are tools that statisticians use to draw conclusions about the characteristics of a population, drawn from the characteristics of a sample, and to decide how certain they can be of the reliability of those conclusions. Based on the sample size and distribution statisticians can calculate the probability that statistics, which measure the central tendency, variability, distribution, and relationships between characteristics within a data sample, provide an accurate picture of the corresponding parameters of the whole population from which the sample is drawn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inferential statistics are used to make generalizations about large groups, such as estimating average demand for a product by surveying a sample of consumers' buying habits or to attempt to predict future events, such as projecting the future return of a security or asset class based on returns in a sample period.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regression analysis is a widely used technique of statistical inference used to determine the strength and nature of the relationship (i.e., the correlation) between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory (independent) variables. The output of a regression model is often analyzed for statistical significance, which refers to the claim that a result from findings generated by testing or experimentation is not likely to have occurred randomly or by chance but is likely to be attributable to a specific cause elucidated by the data. Having statistical significance is important for academic disciplines or practitioners that rely heavily on analyzing data and research."

        "\n",
        "Nominal Level Measurement. There is no numerical or quantitative value, and qualities are not ranked. Instead, nominal level measurements are simply labels or categories assigned to other variables. It's easiest to think of nominal level measurements as non-numerical facts about a variable. Example: The name of the President elected in 2020 was Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinal Level Measurement: Outcomes can be arranged in an order, however, all data values have the same value or weight. Although numerical, ordinal level measurements in statistics can't be subtracted against each other as only the position of the data point matters. Often incorporated into nonparametric statistics, ordinal levels are often compared against the total variable group. Example: American Fred Kerley was the 2nd fastest man at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics based on 100-meter sprint times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interval Level Measurement: Outcomes can be arranged in order; however differences between data values may now have meaning. Two different data points are often used to compare the passing of time or changing conditions within a data set. There is often no \"starting point\" for the range of data values, and calendar dates or temperatures may not have a meaningful intrinsic zero value. Example: Inflation hit 8.6% in May 2022. The last time inflation was this high was December 1981.\n",

        "Ratio Level Measurement: Outcomes can be arranged in order, and differences between data values now have meaning.

        "First, knowing the level of measurement helps you decide how to interpret the data from that variable. When you know that a measure is nominal (like the one just described), then you know that the numerical values are just short codes for the longer names. Second, knowing the level of measurement helps you decide what statistical analysis is appropriate on the values that were assigned. If a measure is nominal, then you know that you would never average the data values or do a t-test on the data.\n",

For example, jersey numbers in basketball are measures at the nominal level. A player with number 30 is not more of anything than a player with number 15, and is certainly not twice whatever number 15 is.\n",
        "\n",
        "In ordinal measurement the attributes can be rank-ordered. Here, distances between attributes do not have any meaning. For example, on a survey you might code Educational Attainment as 0=less than high school; 1=some high school.; 2=high school degree; 3=some college; 4=college degree; 5=post college. In this measure, higher numbers mean more education. But is distance from 0 to 1 same as 3 to 4? Of course not. The interval between values is not interpretable in an ordinal measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In interval measurement the distance between attributes does have meaning. For example, when we measure temperature (in Fahrenheit), the distance from 30-40 is same as distance from 70-80. The interval between values is interpretable. Because of this, it makes sense to compute an average of an interval variable, where it doesn’t make sense to do so for ordinal scales. But note that in interval measurement ratios don’t make any sense - 80 degrees is not twice as hot as 40 degrees (although the attribute value is twice as large).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, in ratio measurement there is always an absolute zero that is meaningful. This means that you can construct a meaningful fraction (or ratio) with a ratio variable. Weight is a ratio variable. In applied social research most “count” variables are ratio, for example, the number of clients in past six months. Why? Because you can have zero clients and because it is meaningful to say that “…we had twice as many clients in the past six months as we did in the previous six months.”\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s important to recognize that there is a hierarchy implied in the level of measurement idea. At lower levels of measurement, assumptions tend to be less restrictive and data analyses tend to be less sensitive. At each level up the hierarchy, the current level includes all of the qualities of the one below it and adds something new. In general, it is desirable to have a higher level of measurement (e.g., interval or ratio) rather than a lower one (nominal or ordinal)."

Such distributions are considered bimodal (if there are two modes) or multi-modal (if there are more than two modes). Distributions without a clear mode are said to be uniform.

It's also known as the 50th percentile, and it can be calculated for ordinal and interval/ratio variables. Conceptually, finding the median is fairly simple and entails only putting all of your observations in order from least to greatest and then finding whichever number falls in the middle. Note that finding the median requires first ordering all of the observations from least to greatest. This is why the median is not an appropriate measure of central tendency for nominal variables, as nominal variables have no inherent order. (In practice, finding the median can be a bit more involved, especially if you have a large number of observations—see your textbook for an explanation of how to find the median in such situations).\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of you are probably already wondering, \"What happens if you have an even number of cases? There won't be a middle number then, right?\" That's a very astute observation, and I'm glad you asked. If your dataset has an even number of cases, the median is the average of the two middlemost numbers. For example, for the numbers 18, 14, 12, 8, 6 and 4, the median is 10 (12 + 8 = 20; 20/2 = 10).\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the median's advantages is that it is not sensitive to outliers. An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a sample. Observations that are significantly larger or smaller than the others in a sample can impact some statistical measures in such a way as to make them highly misleading, but the median is immune to them. In other words, it doesn't matter if the biggest number is 20 or 20,000; it still only counts as one number. Consider the following:\n",

        "The Mean\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean is what people typically refer to as \"the average\". It is the highest measure of central tendency, by which I mean it is available for use only with interval/ratio variables. The mean takes into account the value of every observation and thus provides the most information of any measure of central tendency. Unlike the median, however, the mean is sensitive to outliers. In other words, one extraordinarily high (or low) value in your dataset can dramatically raise (or lower) the mean. The mean, often shown as an x or a y variable with a line over it (pronounced either \"x-bar\" or \"y-bar\"), is the sum of all the scores divided by the total number of scores.\n",

If you score in the 72nd percentile on a test, 72 percent of the students who took the test scored below you. If scored in the 5th percentile on a test, maybe that subject isn't for you.

        "This equation looks intimidating, but it's not that bad once you break it down into its component parts. S2x is the notation used to denote the variance of a sample. That giant sigma (Σ) is a summation sign; it just means we're going to be adding things together. The x represents each of our observations, and the x with a line over it (often called \"x-bar\") represents the mean of our distribution. The capital \"N\" on the bottom is the total number of observations. Basically, this formula is telling us to subtract the mean from each of our observations, square the difference, add them all together and divide by N-1. Let's do an example using the above numbers.\n",

        "1. The first step in calculating the variance is finding the mean of the distribution. In this case, the mean is 5 (2+3+5+6+9 = 25; 25/5 = 5).\n",

The bigger the number, the more variability we have in our distribution. Please note: a variance can never be negative. If you come up with a variance that's less than zero, you've done something wrong.\n",

        "There is, however, one limitation to using the variance as our only measure of variability. When we square the numbers to get rid of the negatives (step 3), we also inadvertently square our unit of measurement. In other words, if we were talking about miles, we accidentally turned our unit of measurement into miles squared. If we were talking about comic books, we accidentally turned our unit of measurement into comic books squared (which, needless to say, doesn't always make a lot of sense). In order to solve that problem, we calculate the standard deviation. The formula for the standard deviation looks like this:\n"
