        "\n",
        "**Probability density function (PDF)** is a statistical expression that defines a probability distribution (the likelihood of an outcome) for a discrete random variable (e.g., a stock or ETF) as opposed to a continuous random variable. The difference between a discrete random variable is that you can identify an exact value of the variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The normal distribution is a common example of a PDF, forming the well-known bell curve shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "In finance, traders and investors use PDFs to understand how price returns are distributed in order to evaluate their risk and expected return profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "Probability mass function\n",
        "\n",
        "Probability mass function can be defined as the probability that a discrete random variable will be exactly equal to some particular value. In other words, the probability mass function assigns a particular probability to every possible value of a discrete random variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Probability Mass Function Example\n",
        "Suppose a fair coin is tossed twice and the sample space is recorded as S = [HH, HT, TH, TT]. The probability of getting heads needs to be determined. Let X be the random variable that shows how many heads are obtained. X can take on the values 0, 1, 2. The probability that X will be equal to 1 is 0.5. Thus, it can be said that the probability mass function of X evaluated at 1 will be 0.5."

        "\n",
        "The cumulative distribution function is used to describe the probability distribution of random variables. It can be used to describe the probability for a discrete, continuous or mixed variable. It is obtained by summing up the probability density function and getting the cumulative probability for a random variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Probability Density Function is a function that gives us the probability distribution of a random variable for any value of it. To get the probability distribution at a point, you only have to solve the probability density function for that point. \n",
        "\n",
        "The cumulative distribution function of a random variable to be calculated at a point x is represented as Fx(X). It is the probability that the random variable X will take a value less than or equal to x.\n",

If we roll two dice simultaneously, there are 36 possible combinations. The probability of rolling ‘1’ (with six possible combinations) again averages to around 16.7%, i.e., (6/36).

        "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental result in probability theory and statistics that describes the behavior of the sum or average of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables. It states that, under certain conditions, the sum or average of such variables will converge to a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the individual variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The significance of the CLT is that it provides a theoretical foundation for many statistical techniques that assume normally distributed data. For example, many hypothesis tests and confidence intervals rely on the assumption of normality, which is often justified by the CLT.\n",
        "Additionally, the CLT is important in practical applications such as quality control, where it is often necessary to estimate the mean and variance of a population based on a sample."
